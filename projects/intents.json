        "\nMandatory Rules:\n1.  Programming Language: Participants must use \"Python\" as the programming language for their solutions.\n2.  Application Type: The application should be a Console Application. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are not allowed.\n3.  Console Communication: All communication with the participants' programs should occur through the console (standard input and output).\n4.  Uniqueness: Each participant's application must be unique. Code similarity among submissions will be scrutinized.\n5.  Original Work: Participants must create their applications from scratch. Code taken from online sources, tutorials, courses, or YouTube videos is not allowed.\n6.  Database Connection: Database connectivity is not required for this competition. Participants should not attempt to connect to a database.\n7.  Submission Format: Participants are required to submit their solutions as .py files within the specified time period. Other file formats will be examined and allowed only if necessary.\n\nConsiderations and Scoring:\n---------------------------\n1.  Code Clarity: Clear and well-documented code with comments and proper formatting will be rewarded with extra points.\n2.  Error Handling: Effective error handling, including try-except blocks, will earn participants extra points for robustness.\n3.  Library Usage: While libraries are allowed, participants who implement functionalities manually (without relying on libraries) will receive extra points.\n4.  Creativity: Creative solutions or unique problem-solving approaches will be recognized and awarded extra marks.",
